My name is Grant Langseth and this is my open-source web page inspired from HTML taken from Type & Grids. I am currently
learning some useful skills in the D3.js library and hope to use this web page to showcase some of my ability.

Please feel free to reach out with any tips or if you want to share any useful tools or ideas.
